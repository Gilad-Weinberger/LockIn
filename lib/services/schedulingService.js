TASKS TO SCHEDULE:
${JSON.stringify(tasksToSchedule, null, 2)}

ADVANCED SCHEDULING FRAMEWORK:

üß† COGNITIVE OPTIMIZATION PRINCIPLES:
- Peak cognitive performance: 9:00-11:00 AM (focus work, complex problem-solving)
- Secondary peak: 2:00-4:00 PM (analytical tasks, planning)  
- Low energy periods: 1:00-2:00 PM (admin, routine tasks), after 5:00 PM
- Context switching penalty: 15-25 minutes to refocus after interruption
- Deep work blocks: Minimum 90 minutes for complex tasks
- Ultradian rhythms: 90-120 minute focused work cycles with 15-20 minute breaks

‚è∞ INTELLIGENT DURATION ESTIMATION:
Analyze each task's title, description, and type to estimate realistic duration:

RESEARCH & LEARNING TASKS:
- "Research [topic]" = 2-3 hours
- "Learn [skill/technology]" = 3-4 hours  
- "Study for [exam]" = 2-4 hours
- "Read [document/book]" = 1-2 hours per 50 pages estimated

CREATIVE & DESIGN WORK:
- "Design [something]" = 2-4 hours
- "Create [content]" = 1.5-3 hours
- "Write [article/report]" = 2-3 hours (500-1000 words/hour)
- "Brainstorm [ideas]" = 1-1.5 hours

DEVELOPMENT & TECHNICAL:
- "Code [feature]" = 3-6 hours depending on complexity
- "Debug [issue]" = 1-4 hours (highly variable)
- "Test [functionality]" = 1-2 hours
- "Deploy [project]" = 0.5-2 hours
- "Review code" = 0.5-1 hour per 200 lines

MEETINGS & COMMUNICATION:
- "Meeting with [person]" = 1 hour (default)
- "Team standup" = 0.5 hours
- "Workshop/training" = 2-4 hours
- "Call [client/vendor]" = 0.5-1 hour
- "Email [task description]" = 0.25-0.5 hours

PROJECT MANAGEMENT:
- "Plan [project]" = 2-3 hours
- "Review progress" = 0.5-1 hour
- "Update documentation" = 1-2 hours
- "Prepare presentation" = 2-4 hours

ADMINISTRATIVE:
- "Fill out [forms]" = 0.5-1 hour
- "Organize [files/system]" = 1-2 hours
- "Schedule [appointments]" = 0.25-0.5 hours

üéØ DEADLINE INTELLIGENCE:
For tasks with deadlines (check taskDate field):
- If deadline is in 1-2 days: Schedule IMMEDIATELY in next available "do" priority slot
- If deadline is in 3-7 days: Schedule in top 3 priority slots this week
- If deadline is in 1-2 weeks: Schedule strategically, allowing buffer time
- If deadline is >2 weeks: Schedule based on priority and workload balance

For tasks containing deadline keywords ("due", "deadline", "submit", "deliver"):
- Add 25% buffer time to estimated duration
- Schedule completion 1 day before actual deadline when possible
- Break large deadline tasks (>4 hours) into multiple sessions

üèÜ PRIORITY-BASED SCHEDULING LOGIC:

DO (Urgent + Important) - PRIME TIME SCHEDULING:
- Schedule during peak cognitive hours (9-11 AM)
- Allow maximum focus time (90-120 minutes minimum)
- Minimal context switching
- Buffer time before/after for preparation and wrap-up

PLAN (Important, Not Urgent) - STRATEGIC SCHEDULING:
- Schedule during secondary peak hours (2-4 PM)
- Allow adequate time for deep thinking
- Group related planning tasks together
- Schedule when energy is good but not at absolute peak

DELEGATE (Urgent, Not Important) - EFFICIENCY SCHEDULING:
- Schedule during collaborative hours (10 AM-12 PM, 2-5 PM)
- Batch similar delegation tasks
- Allow time for follow-up and communication
- Schedule when others are likely available

üõ°Ô∏è ADVANCED CONSTRAINTS:

TEMPORAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Core work hours: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM (Monday-Friday)
- Lunch break: 12:00-1:00 PM (no scheduling)
- No weekend work unless explicitly mentioned in user rules
- Morning energy protection: Reserve 9-11 AM for highest priority work
- Afternoon energy dip: 1-2 PM reserved for low-cognitive tasks only

COGNITIVE CONSTRAINTS:
- Maximum 4 hours of deep work per day
- No more than 2 consecutive high-focus tasks
- 15-minute buffer between different types of tasks
- 30-minute buffer between high-intensity tasks
- Maximum 6 hours of scheduled work per day (leave 2 hours for spontaneous work)

WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION:
- Group similar tasks together (batch processing)
- Schedule complementary tasks in sequence when possible
- Avoid context switching between vastly different task types
- Front-load important tasks earlier in the week
- Leave Friday afternoons lighter for review and planning

üé® PERSONALIZATION FACTORS:
Consider these patterns unless user rules specify otherwise:
- Monday: Planning and strategy, easier ramp-up
- Tuesday-Thursday: Peak productivity days, highest priority work
- Friday: Review, cleanup, lighter tasks, planning for next week
- Account for meeting-heavy days by scheduling shorter focused work blocks
- Consider commute times and personal energy patterns if mentioned in user context

üìä INTELLIGENT SCHEDULING OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

For each scheduled task, provide:
1. **Optimal Time Slot**: Based on task complexity and cognitive demands
2. **Precise Duration**: Estimated based on task analysis, not generic defaults
3. **Strategic Reasoning**: Detailed explanation of WHY this specific time was chosen
4. **Buffer Considerations**: How transitions and context switching were handled
5. **Energy Alignment**: How the scheduling matches cognitive energy patterns
6. **Priority Justification**: Why this task gets this priority level in the schedule

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
‚úÖ Every task must be scheduled (no orphaned tasks)
‚úÖ No time conflicts or overlaps
‚úÖ Realistic time estimates based on task analysis
‚úÖ Strategic use of peak energy periods
‚úÖ Adequate buffers and transition time
‚úÖ Deadline awareness and backward planning
‚úÖ Priority-based optimal time allocation
‚úÖ Workflow optimization and task grouping

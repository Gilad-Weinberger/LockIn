CURRENT CONTEXT:
- Today's Date: ${todayISO}
- Current Time: ${currentDate.toLocaleTimeString()}

TASKS TO PRIORITIZE:
${JSON.stringify(tasksForAI, null, 2)}

BASIC PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK:

Use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks:

**DO (Urgent + Important):**
- High importance and high urgency
- Immediate consequences if delayed
- Critical deadlines within 24-48 hours
- DEADLINE PRIORITY: Tasks with deadlines in the next 1-3 days should automatically go here if there's time to complete them

**PLAN (Important but Not Urgent):**
- High importance but low urgency
- Strategic work that builds toward goals
- Long-term projects and skill development
- Tasks with deadlines >1 week away but still important

**DELEGATE (Urgent but Not Important):**
- High urgency but low importance
- Tasks that can be done by others
- Routine work with time pressure

**DELETE (Neither Urgent nor Important):**
- Low importance and low urgency
- Tasks that don't contribute to goals
- Time-wasting activities

DEADLINE HANDLING RULES:
1. Check each task for 'taskDate' field indicating deadline
2. Calculate days until deadline from today's date
3. If deadline is 1-3 days away: Move to DO quadrant (even if normally would be PLAN)
4. If deadline is 4-7 days away: High priority within current quadrant
5. If deadline is overdue: IMMEDIATE DO priority
6. Tasks with words like "urgent", "ASAP", "due today": Treat as immediate DO priority

PRIORITIZATION RULES:
- Focus on deadlines and immediate consequences first
- Consider task importance to your main goals
- Group similar tasks together when possible
- Aim for a balanced workload
- Don't overload DO quadrant - max 5-7 tasks

Analyze each task and place it in the appropriate quadrant. Provide brief reasoning for your decisions.

TASKS TO ANALYZE AND PRIORITIZE:
${JSON.stringify(tasksForAI, null, 2)}

ADVANCED PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK:

üö® CRITICAL DEADLINE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM:
Perform sophisticated deadline analysis for every task:

**DEADLINE SEVERITY MATRIX:**
For tasks with 'taskDate' field, calculate time pressure:
- CRITICAL (0-1 days): Immediate DO priority - catastrophic consequences if missed
- URGENT (2-3 days): High DO priority - significant negative impact if missed  
- MODERATE (4-7 days): Prioritize within current quadrant - manageable pressure
- LOW (8-14 days): Normal prioritization but monitor progress
- PLANNING (15+ days): Long-term strategic placement

**DEADLINE OVERRIDE LOGIC:**
- Tasks with deadlines in 0-3 days: FORCE MOVE to DO quadrant (unless physically impossible to complete in time)
- Tasks with deadlines in 4-7 days: Elevate priority within current quadrant by 2 levels
- Overdue tasks: IMMEDIATE DO priority, highest urgency ranking
- Buffer time analysis: Consider if task can realistically be completed before deadline
- Cascade effect: Identify tasks that become urgent due to dependencies

**COMPLETION TIME ASSESSMENT:**
For each deadline task, estimate:
- Required completion time based on complexity
- Available working time until deadline
- Buffer time needed (20-30% extra for complex tasks)
- Dependencies that must be completed first
- Risk level if deadline is missed (career, financial, relationship impact)

üéØ STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE ANALYSIS:
Evaluate each task's strategic value using multiple dimensions:

**IMPACT ASSESSMENT:**
- Revenue/Career Impact: Direct effect on income, career advancement, business growth
- Relationship Impact: Effect on professional relationships, team dynamics, reputation
- Learning Impact: Skill development, knowledge acquisition, capability building
- Health/Wellbeing Impact: Physical, mental, emotional health consequences
- Long-term Consequences: Future opportunities created or lost

**LEVERAGE EVALUATION:**
- High Leverage: Small effort, big results (multiplier effect)
- Medium Leverage: Proportional effort to results
- Low Leverage: High effort, small results (potential time sinks)
- Negative Leverage: Creates more problems than it solves

**COMPLEXITY & COGNITIVE LOAD:**
- Simple: Can be done quickly with minimal mental energy
- Moderate: Requires focused attention but manageable
- Complex: Needs deep thinking, research, or significant skill
- Overwhelming: May need to be broken down into smaller tasks

‚ö° URGENCY INTELLIGENCE:
Move beyond simple deadline analysis to sophisticated urgency evaluation:

**DEADLINE PRESSURE ANALYSIS:**
- Imminent (0-2 days): Absolute priority, high stress impact
- Near-term (3-7 days): Significant pressure, needs immediate attention
- Medium-term (1-4 weeks): Moderate pressure, plan strategically
- Long-term (1+ months): Low pressure, opportunity for excellence

**CONSEQUENCE SEVERITY:**
- Critical: Catastrophic consequences if missed (legal, financial, career-ending)
- High: Significant negative impact (missed opportunities, damaged relationships)
- Medium: Moderate inconvenience or disappointment
- Low: Minimal real-world impact

**DEPENDENCY CHAINS:**
- Blocking Others: Tasks that prevent others from working (highest urgency)
- Blocked by Others: Tasks waiting on external dependencies (lower urgency)
- Independent: Can be done anytime without affecting others
- Chain Reaction: Completing this unlocks multiple other tasks

**WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY:**
- Time-sensitive: Must be done within specific timeframe
- Seasonal: Optimal timing based on cycles, trends, availability
- Momentum-based: Builds on current energy or progress
- Flexible: Can be done anytime with equal effectiveness

üß† PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS:
Consider human psychology in prioritization decisions:

**ENERGY MATCHING:**
- High-energy tasks: Creative work, complex problem-solving, important decisions
- Medium-energy tasks: Routine work, familiar activities, moderate challenges
- Low-energy tasks: Administrative work, simple communications, organizing

**MOTIVATION & RESISTANCE:**
- High motivation: Exciting, aligned with values, intrinsically rewarding
- Medium motivation: Somewhat interesting, mixed feelings
- Low motivation: Boring but necessary, external pressure only
- High resistance: Anxiety-provoking, skill gaps, fear of failure

**COMPLETION PSYCHOLOGY:**
- Quick wins: Build momentum and confidence (good for low-energy periods)
- Deep work: Require sustained focus and peak mental state
- Batch-able: Similar tasks that can be grouped for efficiency
- Interruptible: Can be started and stopped without losing progress

üîç ADVANCED CATEGORIZATION LOGIC:

**DO (Urgent + Important) - IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
Must meet ALL criteria OR have overriding deadline urgency:
‚úÖ High importance (significant impact on goals/wellbeing) OR deadline within 3 days
‚úÖ High urgency (immediate consequences if delayed) OR cannot wait longer
‚úÖ Within your direct control and capability
‚úÖ Cannot be effectively delegated OR delegation would take too long
‚úÖ Deadline within 72 hours OR catastrophic consequences OR blocking others

DEADLINE OVERRIDE: Any task with deadline ‚â§3 days automatically qualifies for DO if completion is feasible

Examples:
- Crisis management and fire-fighting
- Legal/compliance deadlines with severe penalties
- Health emergencies or critical personal issues
- Client deliverables with contract implications
- Tasks blocking critical team members
- Any task due within 72 hours that you can realistically complete

**PLAN (Important but Not Urgent) - STRATEGIC FOCUS:**
The most critical category for long-term success:
‚úÖ High importance (aligned with major goals/values)
‚úÖ Low-medium urgency (no immediate deadline pressure >3 days)
‚úÖ Requires strategic thinking and quality execution
‚úÖ Builds capabilities, relationships, or future opportunities
‚úÖ Prevention rather than reaction

DEADLINE CONSIDERATION: Tasks with deadlines 4-10 days away get elevated priority within this quadrant

Examples:
- Skill development and learning
- Relationship building and networking
- Strategic planning and goal setting
- System improvements and optimization
- Creative projects and innovation
- Health and wellness activities
- Financial planning and investment
- Important projects with moderate deadlines

**DELEGATE (Urgent but Not Important) - EFFICIENCY FOCUS:**
Tasks that create urgency but don't advance your core objectives:
‚úÖ High urgency (time pressure or external demands)
‚úÖ Low importance (minimal impact on your key goals)
‚úÖ Can be done by others (within their capabilities)
‚úÖ Routine, repeatable, or within standard procedures
‚úÖ Provides learning opportunities for others

DEADLINE FACTOR: Even with near deadlines, if truly unimportant to your goals, delegation remains best option

Examples:
- Routine administrative tasks
- Information gathering and research
- Standard communications and updates
- Meeting coordination and scheduling
- Basic customer service inquiries
- Data entry and processing

**DELETE (Neither Urgent nor Important) - ELIMINATION:**
Tasks that waste time and energy without meaningful return:
‚úÖ Low importance (minimal impact on goals)
‚úÖ Low urgency (no real consequences if ignored)
‚úÖ Legacy tasks that are no longer relevant
‚úÖ Perfectionist activities with diminishing returns
‚úÖ Procrastination activities disguised as work

DEADLINE REALITY CHECK: Even tasks with deadlines should be deleted if they truly don't matter

Examples:
- Excessive email checking and social media
- Perfectionist tweaking of completed work
- Attending irrelevant meetings or events
- Outdated processes that no longer serve a purpose
- Busy work that creates illusion of productivity

üé® CONTEXTUAL INTELLIGENCE:
Consider broader context in prioritization decisions:

**TASK INTERDEPENDENCIES:**
- Prerequisite tasks: Must be completed before others can start
- Parallel tasks: Can be worked on simultaneously
- Sequential tasks: Follow logical order but flexible timing
- Optional tasks: Nice-to-have but not essential

**RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS:**
- Time availability: How much focused time do you realistically have?
- Energy patterns: When are you most/least productive?
- Tool/system requirements: What resources are needed?
- Collaboration needs: When are others available?

**STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT:**
- Core objectives: Direct contribution to primary goals
- Role responsibilities: Essential functions of your position
- Value proposition: What you're uniquely positioned to deliver
- Growth opportunities: Chances to expand capabilities or influence

üìä ADVANCED PRIORITIZATION OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

For each task, provide comprehensive analysis:
1. **Strategic Importance Score** (1-10): Overall value to goals and objectives
2. **Deadline Urgency Analysis**: Time pressure and completion feasibility
3. **Complexity Evaluation**: Mental energy and time requirements
4. **Leverage Factor**: Effort-to-impact ratio
5. **Dependency Status**: How it affects or is affected by other tasks
6. **Energy Requirements**: Cognitive load and optimal timing
7. **Quadrant Placement**: Why it belongs in specific category
8. **Priority Ranking**: Within-category priority order with reasoning

CRITICAL DECISION PRINCIPLES:
üî• DEADLINE FIRST: If task has deadline ‚â§3 days and is completable, it goes to DO
üî• When in doubt between quadrants, ask: "What happens if this waits until tomorrow?"
üî• If the answer is "catastrophic consequences" ‚Üí DO
üî• If the answer is "missed opportunity for improvement" ‚Üí PLAN  
üî• If the answer is "someone else gets frustrated" ‚Üí DELEGATE
üî• If the answer is "nothing significant happens" ‚Üí DELETE

QUADRANT BALANCE:
- Better to have 3-5 well-prioritized DO tasks than 10 poorly chosen ones
- Focus on impact and leverage, not just urgency
- Consider the psychological and strategic dimensions
- Account for your unique context, energy patterns, and constraints
- Prioritize based on value creation and deadline reality, not just time pressure

TASKS TO SCHEDULE:
${JSON.stringify(tasksToSchedule, null, 2)}

ENHANCED SCHEDULING FRAMEWORK:

**CRITICAL DEADLINE HANDLING:**
For tasks with deadlines (check 'taskDate' field):
1. Calculate days remaining until deadline
2. Estimate task completion time needed
3. Schedule task to finish AT LEAST 1 day BEFORE deadline (buffer time)
4. If deadline is within 1-2 days: Schedule IMMEDIATELY in next available slot
5. If deadline is overdue: Schedule as first priority TODAY

**Event Scheduling Rules:**
- Events (type="event") with taskDate MUST be scheduled on their original date
- Extract the date from taskDate and use it as the scheduling date
- Only adjust the time of day if no specific time is provided
- Events cannot be moved to different dates for optimization

**Deadline Buffer Requirements:**
- Tasks due tomorrow: Schedule today if possible
- Tasks due in 2-3 days: Schedule with 1 day buffer
- Tasks due in 4-7 days: Schedule with 2 day buffer
- Complex tasks (>2 hours): Add extra 25% time buffer

**Smart Time Estimation:**
Analyze each task's title and description to estimate realistic duration:

COMMON TASK PATTERNS:
- "Research [topic]": 1.5-2.5 hours
- "Write [document]": 1-2 hours (depending on length)
- "Meeting with [person]": 1 hour (default)
- "Review [item]": 30-60 minutes
- "Plan [project]": 1.5-2 hours
- "Call [person]": 30-45 minutes
- "Email [task]": 15-30 minutes
- "Create [content]": 1-3 hours (based on complexity)
- "Debug/Fix [issue]": 1-2 hours
- Administrative tasks: 30-60 minutes

DEADLINE TASK ADJUSTMENTS:
- Add 25% buffer time to tasks with deadlines within 7 days
- For urgent deadlines (1-2 days): Add 50% buffer time
- Break large tasks (>3 hours) into multiple sessions if deadline is tight

**Productive Working Hours:**
- Peak focus time: 9:00-11:00 AM (best for important/complex work)
- Good work time: 11:00 AM-12:00 PM, 2:00-5:00 PM
- Lunch break: 12:00-1:00 PM (avoid scheduling)
- Collaborative time: 10:00 AM-12:00 PM, 2:00-4:00 PM (good for meetings/calls)
- End of day: After 5:00 PM (light tasks only)
- Weekend: Avoid unless task specifically mentions weekend work

**Priority-Based Scheduling Logic:**

DO TASKS (Urgent + Important):
- Schedule first in peak focus hours (9:00-11:00 AM)
- Allow adequate time without rushing
- Minimize distractions by grouping similar tasks
- DEADLINE PRIORITY: Tasks with deadlines ‚â§3 days get premium time slots

PLAN TASKS (Important, Not Urgent):
- Schedule during good work hours (11:00 AM-12:00 PM, 2:00-4:00 PM)
- Allow time for thoughtful work
- Can be flexible with timing unless deadline approaching

DELEGATE TASKS (Urgent, Not Important):
- Schedule during collaborative hours when others are available
- Can be batched together for efficiency
- Schedule earlier in the day when possible

**Smart Constraints:**
- No overlapping tasks
- 15-minute buffer between different types of tasks
- Maximum 5 hours of scheduled work per day (free tier limit)
- Try to group similar tasks together when possible
- Leave gaps for unexpected interruptions
- Schedule demanding tasks when energy is higher

**Deadline Awareness:**
- Tasks with deadlines in 1-2 days: Schedule immediately as DO priority
- Tasks with deadlines in 3-7 days: Schedule as high priority with buffer time
- Tasks mentioning "urgent", "ASAP", "due": Treat as high priority
- Always schedule completion BEFORE actual deadline

For each task, provide:
- Optimal start and end times based on task type, priority, and deadline
- Clear reasoning for timing choice including deadline considerations
- Duration justification based on task analysis

ADVANCED SCHEDULING FRAMEWORK:

üö® ELITE DEADLINE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
Advanced deadline intelligence for optimal scheduling:

**DEADLINE RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX:**
For each task with 'taskDate', perform comprehensive analysis:

CRITICAL DEADLINE ZONES:
- EMERGENCY (0-1 days): Immediate scheduling, drop everything else, maximum focus time
- URGENT (2-3 days): Premium time slots, 40-50% buffer time, break into smaller sessions if needed
- MODERATE (4-7 days): High priority scheduling, 30% buffer time, strategic placement
- COMFORTABLE (8-14 days): Normal priority, 20% buffer time, optimal energy matching
- PLANNING (15+ days): Strategic placement, standard buffer, focus on quality time slots

**INTELLIGENT BUFFER CALCULATION:**
Dynamic buffer time based on multiple factors:
- Task complexity: Simple (10%), Moderate (20%), Complex (30-40%)
- Deadline pressure: Tight deadline (+20%), Normal deadline (+10%)
- Risk tolerance: High stakes (+25%), Medium stakes (+15%), Low stakes (+10%)
- Historical completion rate: If user typically runs late (+30%)
- Dependencies: If task blocks others (+25%)

**BACKWARD PLANNING ALGORITHM:**
1. Identify absolute deadline from taskDate
2. Calculate required completion time with appropriate buffer
3. Identify prerequisite work and dependencies
4. Schedule final deadline work session to complete 24-48 hours BEFORE actual deadline
5. Create milestone check-ins for complex tasks (>4 hours total time)
6. Front-load difficult/risky portions of deadline work

**DEADLINE CASCADE ANALYSIS:**
- Map task dependencies and their impact on scheduling
- Identify which delayed tasks create cascading deadline pressure
- Prioritize tasks that unblock other deadline-critical work
- Create contingency time slots for high-risk deadline tasks

üß† COGNITIVE OPTIMIZATION PRINCIPLES:
- Peak cognitive performance: 9:00-11:00 AM (focus work, complex problem-solving)
- Secondary peak: 2:00-4:00 PM (analytical tasks, planning)  
- Low energy periods: 1:00-2:00 PM (admin, routine tasks), after 5:00 PM
- Context switching penalty: 15-25 minutes to refocus after interruption
- Deep work blocks: Minimum 90 minutes for complex tasks
- Ultradian rhythms: 90-120 minute focused work cycles with 15-20 minute breaks

üóìÔ∏è CRITICAL EVENT SCHEDULING RULES:
For tasks with type="event" and a taskDate:
- ALWAYS schedule the event on its original taskDate
- The startDate MUST be set to the date from taskDate 
- Only adjust the time of day if no specific time is provided
- Events cannot be moved to different dates - they are fixed appointments
- If taskDate specifies a time, preserve it exactly
- If taskDate only has date, schedule during appropriate hours for the event type

‚è∞ INTELLIGENT DURATION ESTIMATION:
Analyze each task's title, description, and type to estimate realistic duration:

RESEARCH & LEARNING TASKS:
- "Research [topic]" = 2-3 hours (+ deadline buffer if applicable)
- "Learn [skill/technology]" = 3-4 hours  
- "Study for [exam]" = 2-4 hours
- "Read [document/book]" = 1-2 hours per 50 pages estimated

CREATIVE & DESIGN WORK:
- "Design [something]" = 2-4 hours
- "Create [content]" = 1.5-3 hours
- "Write [article/report]" = 2-3 hours (500-1000 words/hour)
- "Brainstorm [ideas]" = 1-1.5 hours

DEVELOPMENT & TECHNICAL:
- "Code [feature]" = 3-6 hours depending on complexity
- "Debug [issue]" = 1-4 hours (highly variable, add extra buffer for deadlines)
- "Test [functionality]" = 1-2 hours
- "Deploy [project]" = 0.5-2 hours
- "Review code" = 0.5-1 hour per 200 lines

MEETINGS & COMMUNICATION:
- "Meeting with [person]" = 1 hour (default)
- "Team standup" = 0.5 hours
- "Workshop/training" = 2-4 hours
- "Call [client/vendor]" = 0.5-1 hour
- "Email [task description]" = 0.25-0.5 hours

PROJECT MANAGEMENT:
- "Plan [project]" = 2-3 hours
- "Review progress" = 0.5-1 hour
- "Update documentation" = 1-2 hours
- "Prepare presentation" = 2-4 hours

ADMINISTRATIVE:
- "Fill out [forms]" = 0.5-1 hour
- "Organize [files/system]" = 1-2 hours
- "Schedule [appointments]" = 0.25-0.5 hours

üéØ ADVANCED DEADLINE INTELLIGENCE:
For tasks with deadlines (check taskDate field):
- If task.type === "event": ALWAYS use the exact taskDate - DO NOT RESCHEDULE EVENTS
- If deadline is in 0-1 days: EMERGENCY scheduling - drop lower priorities, maximum focus time
- If deadline is in 2-3 days: URGENT scheduling - premium time slots, high buffer time
- If deadline is in 4-7 days: HIGH PRIORITY - strategic placement with moderate buffer
- If deadline is in 1-2 weeks: MODERATE PRIORITY - balanced scheduling with standard buffer  
- If deadline is >2 weeks: NORMAL PRIORITY - optimize for quality and energy alignment

EVENT SCHEDULING PRIORITY (MOST IMPORTANT):
- Events (type="event") with taskDate MUST be scheduled on their original date
- Extract the date from taskDate and use it as the scheduling date
- Only optimize the time of day within that date
- Never move events to different dates for "optimization"

ADVANCED DEADLINE STRATEGIES:
- For critical deadlines (0-3 days): Break large tasks into smaller, manageable sessions
- Schedule review/polish time BEFORE final deadline
- Create buffer sessions for unexpected issues
- Front-load the most challenging aspects when energy is highest
- Leave final day before deadline for review, not core work

üèÜ ADVANCED DEADLINE-DRIVEN SCHEDULING LOGIC:

**CRITICAL SCHEDULING HIERARCHY - PROCESS IN THIS EXACT ORDER:**

**PHASE 1: EMERGENCY & DO-LEVEL DEADLINE IDENTIFICATION**
First, categorize ALL tasks by their deadline urgency level:

DO-LEVEL DEADLINES (Schedule FIRST, get PRIME TIME):
- Tasks with deadlines 0-3 days away (regardless of importance)
- Tasks marked as urgent + important from prioritization
- Tasks with words like "urgent", "ASAP", "critical", "emergency"
- Tasks blocking other people or critical processes
- Overdue tasks (immediate priority)

PLAN-LEVEL DEADLINES (Schedule SECOND, after all DO-level are placed):
- Tasks with deadlines 4-14 days away
- Important but not urgent tasks from prioritization
- Strategic/developmental work
- Tasks that build toward long-term goals

DELEGATE/DELETE TASKS (Schedule LAST, fill remaining time):
- Routine tasks without critical deadlines
- Tasks that could be delegated
- Low-importance activities

**PHASE 2: DO-LEVEL DEADLINE SCHEDULING (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY)**
For all DO-level deadline tasks, apply this aggressive scheduling approach:

IMMEDIATE PLACEMENT RULES:
- Schedule DO-level deadlines in the VERY NEXT available prime time slots
- Prime time hierarchy: 9-11 AM ‚Üí 2-4 PM ‚Üí 10 AM-12 PM ‚Üí 2-6 PM
- If multiple DO-level deadlines: Schedule closest deadline first
- Break large DO-level tasks into smaller sessions if needed to fit sooner
- DO-level tasks can "bump" PLAN-level tasks from prime time slots
- Maximum buffer time: 50% for DO-level deadlines (they need to be done fast but right)

EMERGENCY DEADLINE PROTOCOL (0-1 days):
- Get the absolute first available working time slot
- Can be scheduled as early as immediately after current time
- Can extend into evening hours if necessary (up to 7 PM)
- Can be split across multiple days if needed
- Override normal energy optimization - schedule when available, not just when optimal

URGENT DEADLINE PROTOCOL (2-3 days):
- Get first available prime time slots (9-11 AM priority)
- Reserve minimum 25% of each day's prime time for these tasks
- Can push PLAN-level tasks to secondary time slots
- Schedule completion at least 1 day before deadline

**PHASE 3: PLAN-LEVEL DEADLINE STRATEGIC SCHEDULING**
Only AFTER all DO-level deadlines are scheduled, then place PLAN-level tasks:

STRATEGIC PLACEMENT RULES:
- Use remaining prime time slots for most important PLAN tasks
- Schedule during secondary peak hours (2-4 PM, 10 AM-12 PM)
- Allow adequate time for deep thinking and quality work
- Group related planning tasks together
- Standard buffer time: 20-30%
- Can be flexible with timing as long as deadline is met with buffer

PLAN-LEVEL DEADLINE OPTIMIZATION:
- Tasks with deadlines 4-7 days: Higher priority within PLAN category
- Tasks with deadlines 8-14 days: Standard PLAN scheduling
- Focus on quality time allocation rather than immediate urgency
- Optimize for energy levels and cognitive demands

**PHASE 4: DELEGATE/DELETE TASK SCHEDULING**
Fill remaining available time slots:

EFFICIENCY SCHEDULING:
- Schedule during collaborative hours (10 AM-12 PM, 2-5 PM)
- Batch similar delegation tasks
- Allow time for follow-up and communication
- Schedule when others are likely available
- Use time slots that don't interfere with prime focus time

**DEADLINE CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROTOCOL:**
When multiple tasks compete for the same prime time slots:

CONFLICT RESOLUTION HIERARCHY:
1. Emergency deadlines (0-1 days) - ALWAYS WIN
2. Urgent DO-level deadlines (2-3 days) - WIN over PLAN-level
3. Multiple DO-level tasks - Closest deadline wins
4. DO-level vs PLAN-level - DO-level ALWAYS wins the prime slot
5. Multiple PLAN-level tasks - Highest importance + closest deadline wins

TASK BUMPING RULES:
- DO-level deadlines can bump PLAN-level tasks from prime time
- Emergency deadlines can bump any other task from any time slot
- When bumping occurs, find the next best available slot for bumped task
- Never bump a task without finding it a new suitable slot

**COGNITIVE ENERGY ALLOCATION FOR DEADLINES:**
- Reserve 60-70% of daily peak cognitive energy for DO-level deadlines
- Reserve 30-40% of daily peak cognitive energy for PLAN tasks
- Use secondary energy periods for DELEGATE tasks
- DO-level deadlines get energy priority even if it means PLAN tasks get less optimal times

üõ°Ô∏è ADVANCED CONSTRAINTS:

TEMPORAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Core work hours: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM (Monday-Friday)
- Lunch break: 12:00-1:00 PM (no scheduling)
- No weekend work unless explicitly mentioned in user rules
- Morning energy protection: Reserve 9-11 AM for highest priority work
- Afternoon energy dip: 1-2 PM reserved for low-cognitive tasks only

COGNITIVE CONSTRAINTS:
- Maximum 4 hours of deep work per day
- No more than 2 consecutive high-focus tasks
- 15-minute buffer between different types of tasks
- 30-minute buffer between high-intensity tasks
- Maximum 6 hours of scheduled work per day (leave 2 hours for spontaneous work)

DEADLINE-SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS:
- Tasks due tomorrow: Schedule today, highest priority time slots
- Tasks due in 2-3 days: Reserve premium morning hours
- No scheduling of complex deadline work after 4 PM (fatigue risk)
- Critical deadline tasks: Double-book time slots if necessary (plan A and plan B times)

WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION:
- Group similar tasks together (batch processing)
- Schedule complementary tasks in sequence when possible
- Avoid context switching between vastly different task types
- Front-load important tasks earlier in the week
- Leave Friday afternoons lighter for review and planning
- Schedule deadline-critical work during peak energy periods

üé® PERSONALIZATION FACTORS:
Consider these patterns unless user rules specify otherwise:
- Monday: Planning and strategy, easier ramp-up, deadline assessment
- Tuesday-Thursday: Peak productivity days, highest priority work, critical deadline work
- Friday: Review, cleanup, lighter tasks, planning for next week
- Account for meeting-heavy days by scheduling shorter focused work blocks
- Consider commute times and personal energy patterns if mentioned in user context
- Reserve early morning hours for deadline-critical work

üìä INTELLIGENT SCHEDULING OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

For each scheduled task, provide:
1. **Optimal Time Slot**: Based on task complexity, cognitive demands, and deadline pressure
2. **Precise Duration**: Estimated based on task analysis with appropriate deadline buffer
3. **Strategic Reasoning**: Detailed explanation of WHY this specific time was chosen
4. **Deadline Impact**: How deadline influenced scheduling decisions and buffer calculations
5. **Buffer Considerations**: How transitions, context switching, and risk were handled
6. **Energy Alignment**: How the scheduling matches cognitive energy patterns
7. **Priority Justification**: Why this task gets this priority level in the schedule

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
‚úÖ Every task must be scheduled (no orphaned tasks)
‚úÖ No time conflicts or overlaps between scheduled tasks
‚úÖ **NO CONFLICTS WITH EXISTING GOOGLE CALENDAR EVENTS** - This is absolutely critical
‚úÖ Maintain 15-minute buffer before and after existing Google Calendar events
‚úÖ Realistic time estimates based on task analysis
‚úÖ **DEADLINE-DRIVEN SCHEDULING**: DO-level deadlines get first priority for prime time slots
‚úÖ **PHASE-BASED SCHEDULING**: Complete all DO-level deadline scheduling before any PLAN-level scheduling
‚úÖ Strategic use of peak energy periods for deadline-critical work
‚úÖ Adequate buffers and transition time, especially for deadline tasks
‚úÖ **DEADLINE AWARENESS**: All tasks scheduled to complete BEFORE their deadlines with appropriate buffer
‚úÖ **AGGRESSIVE DO-LEVEL PRIORITIZATION**: DO-level deadlines scheduled as soon as possible in next available prime slots
‚úÖ Priority-based optimal time allocation with DO > PLAN > DELEGATE hierarchy
‚úÖ Workflow optimization and task grouping while respecting deadline priorities
‚úÖ **EVENTS MUST PRESERVE ORIGINAL TASKDATE** - Never move events to different dates
‚úÖ For events, extract date from taskDate and schedule on that exact date
‚úÖ **BACKWARD PLANNING**: Critical deadline tasks scheduled with sufficient time before due date
‚úÖ **TASK BUMPING**: DO-level tasks can bump PLAN-level tasks from prime time if needed

DEADLINE SCHEDULING HIERARCHY (STRICTLY ENFORCED):
1. **EMERGENCY deadlines (0-1 days)**: Get IMMEDIATE next available time slot, override all other priorities
2. **URGENT DO-level deadlines (2-3 days)**: Get next available prime time slots, can bump PLAN tasks
3. **MODERATE DO-level deadlines (4-7 days)**: Higher priority than any PLAN task for prime time
4. **PLAN-level deadlines (4-14 days)**: Only scheduled AFTER all DO-level deadlines are placed
5. **DELEGATE/DELETE tasks**: Fill remaining time slots after both DO and PLAN are scheduled

**SCHEDULING PROCESS VERIFICATION:**
Before finalizing schedule, verify:
- All DO-level deadline tasks are scheduled before any PLAN-level tasks in terms of time slot quality
- Emergency deadlines (0-1 days) are scheduled in the very next available working time
- No PLAN-level task occupies a prime time slot if a DO-level task needs it
- DO-level tasks have aggressive but realistic scheduling (as soon as possible)
- All deadline tasks complete with appropriate buffer time before their due dates

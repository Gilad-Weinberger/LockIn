TASKS TO PRIORITIZE:
${JSON.stringify(tasksForAI, null, 2)}

BASIC PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK:

Use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks:

**DO (Urgent + Important):**
- High importance and high urgency
- Immediate consequences if delayed
- Critical deadlines within 24-48 hours

**PLAN (Important but Not Urgent):**
- High importance but low urgency
- Strategic work that builds toward goals
- Long-term projects and skill development

**DELEGATE (Urgent but Not Important):**
- High urgency but low importance
- Tasks that can be done by others
- Routine work with time pressure

**DELETE (Neither Urgent nor Important):**
- Low importance and low urgency
- Tasks that don't contribute to goals
- Time-wasting activities

PRIORITIZATION RULES:
- Focus on deadlines and immediate consequences
- Consider task importance to your main goals
- Group similar tasks together when possible
- Aim for a balanced workload

Analyze each task and place it in the appropriate quadrant. Provide brief reasoning for your decisions.

TASKS TO ANALYZE AND PRIORITIZE:
${JSON.stringify(tasksForAI, null, 2)}

ADVANCED PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK:

üéØ STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE ANALYSIS:
Evaluate each task's strategic value using multiple dimensions:

**IMPACT ASSESSMENT:**
- Revenue/Career Impact: Direct effect on income, career advancement, business growth
- Relationship Impact: Effect on professional relationships, team dynamics, reputation
- Learning Impact: Skill development, knowledge acquisition, capability building
- Health/Wellbeing Impact: Physical, mental, emotional health consequences
- Long-term Consequences: Future opportunities created or lost

**LEVERAGE EVALUATION:**
- High Leverage: Small effort, big results (multiplier effect)
- Medium Leverage: Proportional effort to results
- Low Leverage: High effort, small results (potential time sinks)
- Negative Leverage: Creates more problems than it solves

**COMPLEXITY & COGNITIVE LOAD:**
- Simple: Can be done quickly with minimal mental energy
- Moderate: Requires focused attention but manageable
- Complex: Needs deep thinking, research, or significant skill
- Overwhelming: May need to be broken down into smaller tasks

‚ö° URGENCY INTELLIGENCE:
Move beyond simple deadline analysis to sophisticated urgency evaluation:

**DEADLINE PRESSURE ANALYSIS:**
- Imminent (0-2 days): Absolute priority, high stress impact
- Near-term (3-7 days): Significant pressure, needs immediate attention
- Medium-term (1-4 weeks): Moderate pressure, plan strategically
- Long-term (1+ months): Low pressure, opportunity for excellence

**CONSEQUENCE SEVERITY:**
- Critical: Catastrophic consequences if missed (legal, financial, career-ending)
- High: Significant negative impact (missed opportunities, damaged relationships)
- Medium: Moderate inconvenience or disappointment
- Low: Minimal real-world impact

**DEPENDENCY CHAINS:**
- Blocking Others: Tasks that prevent others from working (highest urgency)
- Blocked by Others: Tasks waiting on external dependencies (lower urgency)
- Independent: Can be done anytime without affecting others
- Chain Reaction: Completing this unlocks multiple other tasks

**WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY:**
- Time-sensitive: Must be done within specific timeframe
- Seasonal: Optimal timing based on cycles, trends, availability
- Momentum-based: Builds on current energy or progress
- Flexible: Can be done anytime with equal effectiveness

üß† PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS:
Consider human psychology in prioritization decisions:

**ENERGY MATCHING:**
- High-energy tasks: Creative work, complex problem-solving, important decisions
- Medium-energy tasks: Routine work, familiar activities, moderate challenges
- Low-energy tasks: Administrative work, simple communications, organizing

**MOTIVATION & RESISTANCE:**
- High motivation: Exciting, aligned with values, intrinsically rewarding
- Medium motivation: Somewhat interesting, mixed feelings
- Low motivation: Boring but necessary, external pressure only
- High resistance: Anxiety-provoking, skill gaps, fear of failure

**COMPLETION PSYCHOLOGY:**
- Quick wins: Build momentum and confidence (good for low-energy periods)
- Deep work: Require sustained focus and peak mental state
- Batch-able: Similar tasks that can be grouped for efficiency
- Interruptible: Can be started and stopped without losing progress

üîç ADVANCED CATEGORIZATION LOGIC:

**DO (Urgent + Important) - IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
Must meet ALL criteria:
‚úÖ High importance (significant impact on goals/wellbeing)
‚úÖ High urgency (immediate consequences if delayed)
‚úÖ Within your direct control and capability
‚úÖ Cannot be effectively delegated
‚úÖ Deadline within 48-72 hours OR catastrophic consequences

Examples:
- Crisis management and fire-fighting
- Legal/compliance deadlines with severe penalties
- Health emergencies or critical personal issues
- Client deliverables with contract implications
- Tasks blocking critical team members

**PLAN (Important but Not Urgent) - STRATEGIC FOCUS:**
The most critical category for long-term success:
‚úÖ High importance (aligned with major goals/values)
‚úÖ Low-medium urgency (no immediate deadline pressure)
‚úÖ Requires strategic thinking and quality execution
‚úÖ Builds capabilities, relationships, or future opportunities
‚úÖ Prevention rather than reaction

Examples:
- Skill development and learning
- Relationship building and networking
- Strategic planning and goal setting
- System improvements and optimization
- Creative projects and innovation
- Health and wellness activities
- Financial planning and investment

**DELEGATE (Urgent but Not Important) - EFFICIENCY FOCUS:**
Tasks that create urgency but don't advance your core objectives:
‚úÖ High urgency (time pressure or external demands)
‚úÖ Low importance (minimal impact on your key goals)
‚úÖ Can be done by others (within their capabilities)
‚úÖ Routine, repeatable, or within standard procedures
‚úÖ Provides learning opportunities for others

Examples:
- Routine administrative tasks
- Information gathering and research
- Standard communications and updates
- Meeting coordination and scheduling
- Basic customer service inquiries
- Data entry and processing

**DELETE (Neither Urgent nor Important) - ELIMINATION:**
Tasks that waste time and energy without meaningful return:
‚úÖ Low importance (minimal impact on goals)
‚úÖ Low urgency (no real consequences if ignored)
‚úÖ Legacy tasks that are no longer relevant
‚úÖ Perfectionist activities with diminishing returns
‚úÖ Procrastination activities disguised as work

Examples:
- Excessive email checking and social media
- Perfectionist tweaking of completed work
- Attending irrelevant meetings or events
- Outdated processes that no longer serve a purpose
- Busy work that creates illusion of productivity

üé® CONTEXTUAL INTELLIGENCE:
Consider broader context in prioritization decisions:

**TASK INTERDEPENDENCIES:**
- Prerequisite tasks: Must be completed before others can start
- Parallel tasks: Can be worked on simultaneously
- Sequential tasks: Follow logical order but flexible timing
- Optional tasks: Nice-to-have but not essential

**RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS:**
- Time availability: How much focused time do you realistically have?
- Energy patterns: When are you most/least productive?
- Tool/system requirements: What resources are needed?
- Collaboration needs: When are others available?

**STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT:**
- Core objectives: Direct contribution to primary goals
- Role responsibilities: Essential functions of your position
- Value proposition: What you're uniquely positioned to deliver
- Growth opportunities: Chances to expand capabilities or influence

üìä PRIORITIZATION OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

For each task, provide comprehensive analysis:
1. **Strategic Importance Score** (1-10): Overall value to goals and objectives
2. **Urgency Analysis**: Deadline pressure and consequence assessment
3. **Complexity Evaluation**: Mental energy and time requirements
4. **Leverage Factor**: Effort-to-impact ratio
5. **Dependency Status**: How it affects or is affected by other tasks
6. **Energy Requirements**: Cognitive load and optimal timing
7. **Quadrant Placement**: Why it belongs in specific category
8. **Priority Ranking**: Within-category priority order with reasoning

CRITICAL DECISION PRINCIPLES:
üî• When in doubt between quadrants, ask: "What happens if this waits until tomorrow?"
üî• If the answer is "catastrophic consequences" ‚Üí DO
üî• If the answer is "missed opportunity for improvement" ‚Üí PLAN  
üî• If the answer is "someone else gets frustrated" ‚Üí DELEGATE
üî• If the answer is "nothing significant happens" ‚Üí DELETE

- Better to have 3 well-prioritized DO tasks than 10 poorly chosen ones
- Focus on impact and leverage, not just urgency
- Consider the psychological and strategic dimensions
- Account for your unique context, energy patterns, and constraints
- Prioritize based on value creation, not just time pressure

TASKS TO SCHEDULE:
${JSON.stringify(tasksToSchedule, null, 2)}

ENHANCED SCHEDULING FRAMEWORK:

**Event Scheduling Rules:**
- Events (type="event") with taskDate MUST be scheduled on their original date
- Extract the date from taskDate and use it as the scheduling date
- Only adjust the time of day if no specific time is provided
- Events cannot be moved to different dates for optimization

**Smart Time Estimation:**
Analyze each task's title and description to estimate realistic duration:

COMMON TASK PATTERNS:
- "Research [topic]": 1.5-2.5 hours
- "Write [document]": 1-2 hours (depending on length)
- "Meeting with [person]": 1 hour (default)
- "Review [item]": 30-60 minutes
- "Plan [project]": 1.5-2 hours
- "Call [person]": 30-45 minutes
- "Email [task]": 15-30 minutes
- "Create [content]": 1-3 hours (based on complexity)
- "Debug/Fix [issue]": 1-2 hours
- Administrative tasks: 30-60 minutes

GENERAL GUIDELINES:
- Simple tasks: 30-60 minutes
- Moderate tasks: 1-2 hours
- Complex tasks: 2-3 hours (max for free tier)
- Add 15-30 minutes buffer for complex tasks

**Productive Working Hours:**
- Peak focus time: 9:00-11:00 AM (best for important/complex work)
- Good work time: 11:00 AM-12:00 PM, 2:00-5:00 PM
- Lunch break: 12:00-1:00 PM (avoid scheduling)
- Collaborative time: 10:00 AM-12:00 PM, 2:00-4:00 PM (good for meetings/calls)
- End of day: After 5:00 PM (light tasks only)
- Weekend: Avoid unless task specifically mentions weekend work

**Priority-Based Scheduling Logic:**

DO TASKS (Urgent + Important):
- Schedule first in peak focus hours (9:00-11:00 AM)
- Allow adequate time without rushing
- Minimize distractions by grouping similar tasks

PLAN TASKS (Important, Not Urgent):
- Schedule during good work hours (11:00 AM-12:00 PM, 2:00-4:00 PM)
- Allow time for thoughtful work
- Can be flexible with timing

DELEGATE TASKS (Urgent, Not Important):
- Schedule during collaborative hours when others are available
- Can be batched together for efficiency
- Schedule earlier in the day when possible

**Smart Constraints:**
- No overlapping tasks
- 15-minute buffer between different types of tasks
- Maximum 5 hours of scheduled work per day (free tier limit)
- Try to group similar tasks together when possible
- Leave gaps for unexpected interruptions
- Schedule demanding tasks when energy is higher

**Deadline Awareness:**
- Tasks with deadlines in 1-2 days: Schedule immediately as DO priority
- Tasks with deadlines in 3-7 days: Schedule as high priority
- Tasks mentioning "urgent", "ASAP", "due": Treat as high priority

For each task, provide:
- Optimal start and end times based on task type and priority
- Clear reasoning for timing choice including energy and priority considerations
- Duration justification based on task analysis

${JSON.stringify(existingGoogleCalendarEvents, null, 2)}

CRITICAL CONFLICT AVOIDANCE RULES:
- NEVER schedule any task during the time slots occupied by existing Google Calendar events
- Ensure at least 15-minute buffer before and after existing events
- If an existing event is all-day, treat the entire day as unavailable for scheduling
- Check both date and time overlap carefully - even partial overlaps are forbidden
- When scheduling around existing events, prioritize tasks that fit well in the available time slots
- Consider the context of existing events (e.g., don't schedule intense work right after a long meeting)
`
    : ""
}

ADVANCED SCHEDULING FRAMEWORK:

üß† COGNITIVE OPTIMIZATION PRINCIPLES:
- Peak cognitive performance: 9:00-11:00 AM (focus work, complex problem-solving)
- Secondary peak: 2:00-4:00 PM (analytical tasks, planning)  
- Low energy periods: 1:00-2:00 PM (admin, routine tasks), after 5:00 PM
- Context switching penalty: 15-25 minutes to refocus after interruption
- Deep work blocks: Minimum 90 minutes for complex tasks
- Ultradian rhythms: 90-120 minute focused work cycles with 15-20 minute breaks

üóìÔ∏è CRITICAL EVENT SCHEDULING RULES:
For tasks with type="event" and a taskDate:
- ALWAYS schedule the event on its original taskDate
- The startDate MUST be set to the date from taskDate 
- Only adjust the time of day if no specific time is provided
- Events cannot be moved to different dates - they are fixed appointments
- If taskDate specifies a time, preserve it exactly
- If taskDate only has date, schedule during appropriate hours for the event type

‚è∞ INTELLIGENT DURATION ESTIMATION:
Analyze each task's title, description, and type to estimate realistic duration:

RESEARCH & LEARNING TASKS:
- "Research [topic]" = 2-3 hours
- "Learn [skill/technology]" = 3-4 hours  
- "Study for [exam]" = 2-4 hours
- "Read [document/book]" = 1-2 hours per 50 pages estimated

CREATIVE & DESIGN WORK:
- "Design [something]" = 2-4 hours
- "Create [content]" = 1.5-3 hours
- "Write [article/report]" = 2-3 hours (500-1000 words/hour)
- "Brainstorm [ideas]" = 1-1.5 hours

DEVELOPMENT & TECHNICAL:
- "Code [feature]" = 3-6 hours depending on complexity
- "Debug [issue]" = 1-4 hours (highly variable)
- "Test [functionality]" = 1-2 hours
- "Deploy [project]" = 0.5-2 hours
- "Review code" = 0.5-1 hour per 200 lines

MEETINGS & COMMUNICATION:
- "Meeting with [person]" = 1 hour (default)
- "Team standup" = 0.5 hours
- "Workshop/training" = 2-4 hours
- "Call [client/vendor]" = 0.5-1 hour
- "Email [task description]" = 0.25-0.5 hours

PROJECT MANAGEMENT:
- "Plan [project]" = 2-3 hours
- "Review progress" = 0.5-1 hour
- "Update documentation" = 1-2 hours
- "Prepare presentation" = 2-4 hours

ADMINISTRATIVE:
- "Fill out [forms]" = 0.5-1 hour
- "Organize [files/system]" = 1-2 hours
- "Schedule [appointments]" = 0.25-0.5 hours

üéØ DEADLINE INTELLIGENCE:
For tasks with deadlines (check taskDate field):
- If task.type === "event": ALWAYS use the exact taskDate - DO NOT RESCHEDULE EVENTS
- If deadline is in 1-2 days: Schedule IMMEDIATELY in next available "do" priority slot
- If deadline is in 3-7 days: Schedule in top 3 priority slots this week
- If deadline is in 1-2 weeks: Schedule strategically, allowing buffer time
- If deadline is >2 weeks: Schedule based on priority and workload balance

EVENT SCHEDULING PRIORITY (MOST IMPORTANT):
- Events (type="event") with taskDate MUST be scheduled on their original date
- Extract the date from taskDate and use it as the scheduling date
- Only optimize the time of day within that date
- Never move events to different dates for "optimization"

For tasks containing deadline keywords ("due", "deadline", "submit", "deliver"):
- Add 25% buffer time to estimated duration
- Schedule completion 1 day before actual deadline when possible
- Break large deadline tasks (>4 hours) into multiple sessions

üèÜ PRIORITY-BASED SCHEDULING LOGIC:

DO (Urgent + Important) - PRIME TIME SCHEDULING:
- Schedule during peak cognitive hours (9-11 AM)
- Allow maximum focus time (90-120 minutes minimum)
- Minimal context switching
- Buffer time before/after for preparation and wrap-up

PLAN (Important, Not Urgent) - STRATEGIC SCHEDULING:
- Schedule during secondary peak hours (2-4 PM)
- Allow adequate time for deep thinking
- Group related planning tasks together
- Schedule when energy is good but not at absolute peak

DELEGATE (Urgent, Not Important) - EFFICIENCY SCHEDULING:
- Schedule during collaborative hours (10 AM-12 PM, 2-5 PM)
- Batch similar delegation tasks
- Allow time for follow-up and communication
- Schedule when others are likely available

üõ°Ô∏è ADVANCED CONSTRAINTS:

TEMPORAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Core work hours: 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM (Monday-Friday)
- Lunch break: 12:00-1:00 PM (no scheduling)
- No weekend work unless explicitly mentioned in user rules
- Morning energy protection: Reserve 9-11 AM for highest priority work
- Afternoon energy dip: 1-2 PM reserved for low-cognitive tasks only

COGNITIVE CONSTRAINTS:
- Maximum 4 hours of deep work per day
- No more than 2 consecutive high-focus tasks
- 15-minute buffer between different types of tasks
- 30-minute buffer between high-intensity tasks
- Maximum 6 hours of scheduled work per day (leave 2 hours for spontaneous work)

WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION:
- Group similar tasks together (batch processing)
- Schedule complementary tasks in sequence when possible
- Avoid context switching between vastly different task types
- Front-load important tasks earlier in the week
- Leave Friday afternoons lighter for review and planning

üé® PERSONALIZATION FACTORS:
Consider these patterns unless user rules specify otherwise:
- Monday: Planning and strategy, easier ramp-up
- Tuesday-Thursday: Peak productivity days, highest priority work
- Friday: Review, cleanup, lighter tasks, planning for next week
- Account for meeting-heavy days by scheduling shorter focused work blocks
- Consider commute times and personal energy patterns if mentioned in user context

üìä INTELLIGENT SCHEDULING OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

For each scheduled task, provide:
1. **Optimal Time Slot**: Based on task complexity and cognitive demands
2. **Precise Duration**: Estimated based on task analysis, not generic defaults
3. **Strategic Reasoning**: Detailed explanation of WHY this specific time was chosen
4. **Buffer Considerations**: How transitions and context switching were handled
5. **Energy Alignment**: How the scheduling matches cognitive energy patterns
6. **Priority Justification**: Why this task gets this priority level in the schedule

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
‚úÖ Every task must be scheduled (no orphaned tasks)
‚úÖ No time conflicts or overlaps between scheduled tasks
‚úÖ **NO CONFLICTS WITH EXISTING GOOGLE CALENDAR EVENTS** - This is absolutely critical
‚úÖ Maintain 15-minute buffer before and after existing Google Calendar events
